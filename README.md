## Overview
This project demonstrates a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier applied to a dataset of employee absenteeism.  
The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature selection, handling missing values, normalization, and classification using both manual and Scikit-learn KNN implementations.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 21 columns related to employee absenteeism, including:
- ID, Reason for absence, Month of absence, Day of the week, Seasons
- Transportation expense, Distance from Residence to Work, Service time, Age
- Work load Average/day, Disciplinary failure, Education, Son, Social drinker, Social smoker, Pet
- Weight, Height, Body mass index, Absenteeism time in hours

## Project Structure
- absenteeism_knn.ipynb : main Jupyter notebook
- data/ : folder containing dataset
- README.md : project description

## Usage
1. Open the notebook `absenteeism_knn.ipynb`
2. Run all cells sequentially to reproduce preprocessing, training, and evaluation
